<h2><span class="smaller">THE</span><br/>
HAPPY VILLAGER.</h2>

<p class="chapter-start">MR. JACKSON had been
an eminent tradesman in the
city of Dublin, where he by
trade acquired an independent
fortune, and was now retired
into the country, to spend the
remainder of his days amidst
rural retreats, to enjoy the
pleasure of rambling through
woods and groves, by the side
of purling and meandering
streams, while the harmony
of the feathered songsters
would charm the ear, and
lull the busy mind into the
most tranquil repose.</p>

<p>The retreat Mr. Jackson
had chosen was situated in the
county of Wicklow, and near
to the place where he drew
his first breath. His house
was a well designed mean between
the vast piles raised for
magnificence, and the smaller
ones in which convenience
alone is considered. The walk
from the back of the house led
through a wood, by the side
of a delightful stream, which
meandered over grass from
out of a deep hollow. A
gush of water which fell into
it, gurgled through a rocky
cavity; and in front you looked
down on a fine lawn, terminated
with a noble bank of
hanging woods.</p>

<p>He would frequently ramble
to a great distance from
home, to survey the beauties
of the surrounding country.
He had already visited every
neighbouring village, and
therefore one day strayed further
than usual in pursuit of
new objects. On a sudden
he discovered a delightful valley,
the appearance of which
seemed to correspond with
every thing descriptive of a
rural scene.</p>

<p>It was surrounded on all
sides by hills, at the feet of
which were thickly scattered
cottages, groves and gardens,
which seemed to be the abode
of rural happiness. The silence
of the scene was broken
only by the dashings of a torrent,
which, rushing from an
eminence, precipitated bellowing
into a cavern beneath.
Having there vented its rage
in foam, it then divided into
a multitude of little rills, and
forming serpentine sweeps,
refreshed the meadows and
surrounding gardens with
its friendly streams.</p>

<p>However pleased Mr. Jackson
was with the natural beauties
of the place, he was no
less struck with the neatness
and simplicity of the many
cottages that presented themselves
to his view, every house
having a garden, an orchard,
and some well cultivated
ground about it. Their only
fences were hedges of holly,
which afforded a convincing
proof of two things, the fertility
of the soil, and the confidence
each one had in his
neighbour.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was so wholly
employed in contemplating
this pleasing scene, that he
paid no attention to a storm
that was gathering around
him, till the lightning flashed
in his face, the thunder rolled
over his head, and the rain
began to fall in torrents. He
instantly ran to the nearest
farm door, and, having there
knocked, gained immediate
admittance.</p>

<p>It was an elderly woman
who came to the door, and
who, though old, was not decripid,
and appeared to have
something venerable in her
countenance. “Come in sir,
(said she), and I will make a
fire to dry you. I am glad
our cottage was so near to
you; but you would have
met with a kind reception in
any of these cottages. There
is hardly a house here which
is not kept by some of our
children or descendants.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson had sufficient
leisure, while the good woman
was lighting the fire, to
survey the apartment. Every
thing appeared uncommonly
neat, and it was easy to be
seen, from the nature of the
furniture, that Necessity had
no abode under that roof.&mdash;The
novelty of the whole
scene, and the particular
words the good old woman
had dropped in conversation
during the lighting of the
fire, gave Mr. Jackson a
strong desire to know further
particulars.</p>

<p>While he was drying his
clothes, he heard a voice in
the other room, asking if the
stranger was taken care of, to
which the good woman replied
in the affirmative. “I
suppose (said Mr. Jackson)
that is your husband in the
next room, whose voice I
hear. May I go in and thank
him for his hospitality and
kindness?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart, sir
(replied the woman), you will
please to step in, and I believe
you will not be dissatisfied
with your reception.” Mr.
Jackson did so; and there
found an old man reclining
on a bed, of which the clothes
and furniture were very neat
and clean. He had on a cap,
and his snow-white locks
hung over his venerable
shoulders. His countenance
indicated the goodness and
serenity of his heart, and even
Time had here been more
sparing of his devastations
than is generally the case.</p>

<p>The appearance of this
happy villager had a great effect
upon Mr. Jackson, who
could not look on him without
being, in some measure
prejudiced in his favour.&mdash;“What
is the matter with
you? (said he to the old cottager)
I suppose you are ill,
and obliged to keep your
bed?”</p>

<p>“God be praised (replied
the old man), that is not the
case; though it cannot be expected,
that a person turned
of four-score years of age
should be free from all kinds
of complaints. It is not a
long time since I have given
up daily labour, which my
children obliged me to do;
for they said I had worked
long enough for them, and
that it was now time they
should work for me in their
turns.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson highly applauded
the conduct of his
children; and observed to the
old man, that he must have
purchased his present repose
at the expence of a great deal
of labour; but he wished to
know, after having passed his
life in such active scenes, how
he could amuse himself at
present.</p>

<p>“My whole life (replied
the old man), has been a constant
succession of labour.
There are few men who have
carried in more hay, or tied
more sheaves together, than I
have; but my labour procured
me health, contentment,
and happiness. As to
time, it never sits heavy on
my hands, and when my body
is at rest, my mind is at work.
How can any person be at a
loss for thoughts, who has ten
children, and fifty children’s
children to think for? They
every day give me an account
of their affairs and labour,
and it is I who put every
thing in order. There is always
one constantly upon my
hands that must be married,
and matches of that kind are
not to be settled in a moment.
Those I have provided for in
this way are now in a thriving
state. I have at this time three
marriages in hands, and I
hope they will soon be settled
to the mutual satisfaction of
all parties.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson observed, that
he must be very happy in so
numerous a family, and asked
him how many he had at
home with him. “I have
at present only two (replied
the old man), who are my
grand-daughters; for I cannot
lodge an army here. It
is my lands, and not my
house, that I wish to enlarge.
Thank God I have been able
to give each of my children a
tolerable portion; not in gold,
but acres, and that without
impoverishing myself. For a
mere trifle, I bought a large
quantity of land, which none
of my neighbours thought
worth meddling with: but I
set about improving it, and
gave it to my daughters as so
many marriage portions, and
are now, in their improved
state, of great value.</p>

<p>“Whenever any of my
children were ill, I had skill
enough to cure them by the
use of those few plants I am
acquainted with, and of their
behaviour to me I never had
any reason to complain. I
always took care to set them a
good example: for though in
my youth I was as wild as
any other, and there could
not be a dance in this or any
neighbouring parish, but I
was sure to be there; yet, as
soon as I was married, I left
off those pranks. My wife
was fortunately handsome,
good, and sprightly, and that
kept me in awe.</p>

<p>“I took my boys into the
fields with me as soon as they
could walk, and I presently
made them useful in one way
or other. I put my youngest
on the plough, and was pleased
to see the others frolic
around him; and, on my return
home in the evening, my
little girls would divert me
with singing, while they were
spinning at their wheel.</p>

<p>“I used to go among my
children and grand children,
to see if every thing went on
properly; but now, since old
age has prevented me, they
come and see me. The sermon
is no sooner over on a
Sunday, than my daughters
and grand daughters bring
their little ones; and it would
please you, sir, to behold me
in the midst of twenty women,
dressed as for a marriage,
and as pretty as angels.
There is a family resemblance
in their children, and that
charms me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson observed, that
the other six days of the week
must be very tiresome to him,
since he could not have the
company of his family to
amuse him. To this the old
man replied, “If I be denied
this pleasure, yet I have others
to supply its place. I know
every inch of ground in this
parish, and am as well acquainted
with all who live in
it. My neighbours therefore
frequently come to ask
my opinion on matters of husbandry,
in which they are
engaged. I give them my
advice with pleasure; and if
they be poor people, I provide
them with the seed they
want, and they repay it me
the ensuing harvest. Thus
am I serviceable to others,
without injuring myself or
my family.</p>

<p>“In my endeavours to do
good to my neighbours, I
am assisted by our vicar, who
is a very good man, and of
whom I have, in some degree,
made a bishop, by the weddings,
christenings and tithes,
with which I have enriched
him. I have even given him
some instructions concerning
his business in the pulpit;
for the country people in general,
like example better than
precept. The general rule
I taught him to lay down to
his congregation was no more
than this: <i>No rest, good neighbours,
to your land; but peace
among yourselves</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson could not help
applauding such principles,
and told the good old villager,
that he apprehended he was
of more service to the vicar,
than he was to the lawyer, if
any such professional man
lived near them.</p>

<p>The good old man replied,
“We have indeed one lawyer
among us, but I have
pretty well spoiled his trade.
Had I taken only sixpence
every time I have been consulted,
in order to settle disputes,
I should at this time
have been a very rich man.
In all places there frequently
will happen disputes of one
kind or other, and principally
when the ground of any deceased
person is to be parcelled
out among his successors.</p>

<p>“On these occasions, they
generally come to me for my
advice; and if there be children
to be married, I soon
settle the affair. If there be
any ground in dispute, and
the parties cannot agree about
it, they take me in their little
cart, and being on the spot, I
have the ground surveyed. I
then weigh the good and bad
qualities of it in my mind,
and endeavour, if I can, to
satisfy the different parties.</p>

<p>“When I find the parties
are not inclined to agree, the
next day I get them all together
here, and I always
keep a barrel of good ale on
the run, such as will soften
the most obdurate and flinty
heart. I give them a glass or
two of it, and in the mean
time I tell them, that a lawsuit
would cost ten times
more than the ground is
worth; that if they proceed
in it, they will lose a great
deal of time as well as money,
and ever be enemies to each
other. These arguments and
a few glasses of ale, never
fail to make up the matter,
and bring about a perfect reconciliation.
It is true, I
lose my ale by such a practice,
but then I am amply repaid
by the reflection of having
done good.”</p>

<p>Here the cottager called to
his wife, and told her to bring
a jug of their ale. Mr. Jackson
drank some of it, and
confessed that it was admirably
calculated to make
peace among his neighbours,
in the village, especially when
administered by so able an
hand, who knew how to extract
friendship from the very
means that often produced
strife and disaffection.</p>

<p>By this time the storm was
entirely abated, Nature had
put off her gloomy aspect,
and the returning sun began
to enliven every thing. Mr.
Jackson took a friendly leave,
and promised to see them
again in a few days. On his
return home, “Who would
not (said he to himself) prefer
the healthful age of this
good cottager, happy in his
own esteem and the love of
others, to the vanity of those
great men, who make no
other use of their abundance,
than to set examples of luxury
and dissipation, who make
light of public scorn and
hatred, and whom the very
grave will not protect from
infamy and execration!”</p>
